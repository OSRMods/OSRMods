Hi, I'm Telani, and I'm intending this to be a place for user modifications for open source sex robots can be shared, indexed, and improved upon.
Currently I'm categorizing by robot, with user directories within those. Suggestions for better methods are welcome.
I realize that with enough contributions of mods, people would be able to construct functional replicas of designs that require payment to access.
I also believe that modification of someone's part to add new function makes it no longer only the product of the owner's work. Dialog is welcome on this from anyone, but I think that an open approach is best for accelerated development of sweet fuck robots.
